## 🧠 Project Motivation

Manual mask compliance monitoring in public places can be tedious and error-prone. This project demonstrates how **deep learning and computer vision** can automate this task using a webcam feed — detecting faces and identifying whether each person is wearing a mask, all in real time.

## 🔍 How It Works

- ✅ Face Detection: Utilizes Haar Cascade Classifier to locate faces in real-time.
- ✅ Mask Classification: A trained CNN model classifies each face as **Masked** or **Unmasked**.
- ✅ Real-Time Inference: Processes frames from webcam with confidence scores.
- ✅ Visual Feedback: Bounding boxes and labels are displayed dynamically.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **OpenCV** – For face detection and real-time video capture
- **TensorFlow/Keras** – For building and training the CNN
- **NumPy** – Numerical computations
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn** – Model evaluation and visualization
